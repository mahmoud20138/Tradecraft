## Quick Install

Inside Claude Code:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mahmoud20138/Tradecraft.git
/plugin install tradecraft@tradecraft
```

> The full HTTPS URL is recommended because the `owner/repo` shorthand can resolve to SSH on some machines and fail if GitHub isn't in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the full setup.

**Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.** The default free data path is cross-platform (yfinance, no credentials). The optional MT5 upgrade path is Windows-only (MetaQuotes ships the `MetaTrader5` Python package for Windows only). See the [platform support matrix](INSTALL.md#platform-support) for details.

For live market data on the `fetch-quotes` / `analyze-*` combination skills (free path, no account, no API key):

```shell
pip install -r "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/requirements.txt"
```

Then invoke any skill by name:

```shell
/tradecraft:analyze-gold                   # XAUUSD combination (fetch -> regime -> ICT -> risk -> plan)
/tradecraft:analyze-us30 H4 conservative   # Dow combination, H4 conservative mode
/tradecraft:pair-analyze EURUSD M15 scalp  # parametric combination for any pair
/tradecraft:fetch-quotes BTCUSD D1 300     # free market data (yfinance) + MT5 if installed
/tradecraft:trading-fundamentals           # any of the 161 knowledge skills
# full list: see COMMANDS.md
```

Each skill is also model-invocable — Claude will auto-select the right skill based on your task context. Run `/help` to browse all skills under the `tradecraft:` namespace. Full step-by-step setup (including optional MT5 for broker-exact prices) is in **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.
